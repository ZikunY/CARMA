\arguments{
\item{z.list}{Input list of the summary statistics of the testing loci, and each element of the list is the summary statistics of each individual locus.}

\item{label.list}{Input list of the names of the testing loci. Default is NULL.}

\value{
The form of the return is a list, for each list:
\itemize{
\item pip - The posterior inclusion probability of each individual locus.
\item Credibleset - The information regarding the credible set given a threshold \eqn{\rho}.
\item Credible model - The information regarding the credible model given a threshold  of the Bayes factor.
\item Outliers - The information regarding the detected outliers.

\description{
Performs a Bayesian fine-mapping model in order to identify putative causal variants at GWAS loci. The model requires the summary statistics
of the SNPs in the testing loci, the corresponding LD matrices for fine-mapping, and an estimated variance of traits. Functional annotations can be included as the prior 
information of the causality of the testing SNPs. The model also provides a procedure of outlier detection, which resolves the discrepancies
between the summary statistics and the LD matrix extracted from reference panels. The model can be executed chromosome-wise to increase power.
}
\details{
The function performs a Bayesian fine-mapping method.
